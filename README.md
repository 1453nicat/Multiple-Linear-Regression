# Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project involves building a multiple linear regression model using the advertising dataset to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditures (TV, newspaper, radio) and sales.

The dataset consists of the following columns:
TV: Budget spent on TV advertising.
Newspaper: Budget spent on newspaper advertising.
Radio: Budget spent on radio advertising.
Sales: Sales generated.

Libraries:
zipfile:
pandas: For data manipulation
matplotlib & seaborn: for data visualization
sklearn: for machine learning tasks
statsmodels: for statistical analysis

Notes:
High RÂ² Score: Indicates that the model explains 91% of the variability in sales.
Low Error Metrics: The MSE, RMSE and MAE  suggest the model's predictions are accurate.
